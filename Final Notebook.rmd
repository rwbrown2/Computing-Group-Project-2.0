I contributed to the computing project by building the rasbian image with the neccesary programs and files for computing I. First I made sure to have a clean version of Rasbian installed onto my raspberry pi machine. I then proceeded to type in the command sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade to update the image to the newest version. I then proceeded to install the following programs given the following commands in the command terminal: (Zotero) sudo apt install zotero-standalone-libreoffice-zotero-integration, (Pandoc citation processor) sudo apt install pandoc-citeproc, (Biber) sudo apt install biber texlive-bibtex-extra, (chemtool/gchempaint) sudo apt install chemtool gchempaint, (Pandoc) sudo apt install pandoc.Git was already installed with the current version of Rasbian used on this device.Once these programs were installed i then proceeded to drag the file containing the files for computing one from the google drive file Gracie had shared with me. Once all of the programs and files were placed upon the device it was ready for the procedure Makayla had made to transfer the rasbian image to another computer using an ethernet cable. I then proceeded to record my part of the project to demonstrate my contributions on May 3rd to turn in May 4th at 1pm. 
Makayla Blassingame: 
Our group project consisted of creating a Rasbian image with all the files necessary for Computing I. I contributed to our project by writing an instruction manual on how to connect the Raspberry Pi to another computer using an Ethernet cable. I also helped to gather the software needed to apply to our Rasbian image. Before writing the manual, I researched different websites in order to find what tools were needed and the steps required to complete the connection. Next, I wrote the detailed instruction manual based on my research and found the steps to be, finding the Ethernet adapter's IP address, finding the autoconfiguration of the IPV4 address, finding the default gateway IP, finding the static domain name servers, and configuring the static IP. Then, I shared it with RodAnthony so that he could apply it to his Rasbian image. Lastly, I accessed the Computing I folder located in Canvas and gathered the software needed to complete our image. Finally, I recorded my contributions of the project to turn in on Canvas. 
Gracie Kieffer:
I contributed to the computing project by downloading all the Computing class 1 files. I went back to the Computing class 1 section in Canvas, and I downloaded every file that could be downloaded on my laptop. Then, I had to figure out how to download those files on Google Drive. Once I dowloaded each file into a folder on Google Drive, I shared it to RodAnthony. I then recorded my part of the project to show how I contributed and turned it in on Canvas.
