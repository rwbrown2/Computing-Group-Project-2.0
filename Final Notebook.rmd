Final Notebook:
RodAnthony Brown:
I contributed to the computing project by building the rasbian image with th neccesary programs and files for computing I. First I made sure to have a clean version of Rasbian installed onto my raspberry pi machine. I then proceeded to type in the command sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade to update the image to the newest version. I then proceeded to install the following programs given the following commands in the command terminal: (Zotero) sudo apt install zotero-standalone-libreoffice-zotero-integration, (Pandoc citation processor) sudo apt install pandoc-citeproc, (Biber) sudo apt install biber texlive-bibtex-extra, (chemtool/gchempaint) sudo apt install chemtool gchempaint, (Pandoc) sudo apt install pandoc.Git was already installed with the current version of Rasbian used on this device.Once these programs were installed i then proceeded to drag the file containing the files for computing one from the google drive file Gracie had shared with me. Once all of the programs and files were placed upon the device it was ready for the procedure Makayla had made to transfer the rasbian image to another computer using an ethernet cable. I then proceeded to record my part of the project to demonstrate my contributions on May 3rd to turn in May 4th at 1pm.
